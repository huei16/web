                <h3> 01. What is Code  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/ ">üîç</a></h3>
                <p> I think this sentence captured the complexity of codes: A language is software for making software. Just learning html and CSS is already so complicated for me, and there could be coders who know very well multiple languages mentioned in the article. I think getting to know about coding makes me really appreciate other coders‚Äô effort for creating all sorts of software that forms my daily life.</p>

                <h3> 02. What Screens Want  <a target="_blank" href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/  ">üîç</a></h3>
                <p> When Frank Chimero is comparing of between flat screen objects or if they should mimic an actual 3D object, he said, it‚Äôs just aesthetic. I also think they‚Äôre incomparable because they were introduced under different generation of screens and people had different perceptions. Digital elements were designed to look analog when they were first introduced, so it‚Äôs easier for people to understand; but now, we‚Äôre so used to digital interfaces, is it necessary for the graphics to look analog? As I noticed how apple and Google interfaces are all becoming more and more ‚Äúflat‚Äù each time we update, I assume the existence of 3D and flat design is just because there were different needs.</p>

                <h3> 03. Vernacular Web  <a target="_blank" href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">üîç</a></h3>
                <p> At the very beginning, the author pointed straight out that the article will be about web pages in the 1990s. I thought the retro look was on purpose at first, but after noticing that some of the links are outdated and not working, I thought, ‚Äúhow old is this website?‚Äù It‚Äôs from 2005! This just reminds me how rapidly the Internet and digital media changes. Olia is critiquing webs made a decade ago from her, yet her article is also a decade ago from us already.</p>

                <div class="blank"></div>
                <h3> 04. Jodi's Infrastructure  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/">üîç</a></h3>
                <p>Jodi‚Äôs art is very visual to me, they challenge the regular way we think about code or web elements, but for me, the meaning of those elements were kind of taken away. I am more interested in the concept of internationalized domain; I wonder if the web will be more inclusive in the future.</p>

                <div class="blank"></div>
                <h3> 05. Capitalism vs. Privacy  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/google-facebook-informational-capitalism/">üîç</a></h3>
                <p>‚Äútaken individually, each piece seems innocuous; taken together, an intimate picture of our person is revealed.‚Äù My first thought was, I get to decide what information I want to let out, so I still have some degree of control my privacy; but my second thought is, what if the companies event keeps an eye on the activities that seemed irrelevant? What if they note every message I sent out through messenger? There‚Äôs actually a lot of things we do that indirectly exposed ourselves. I guess there isn‚Äôt such thing as privacy in informational capitalism‚Ä¶</p>

                <h3> 06. Critical Atlas of Internet  <a target="_blank" href="http://internet-atlas.net/">üîç</a></h3>
                <p>Navigating this website was like an adventure! I like how there‚Äôs a lot of images that visualizes Louise Drulhe‚Äôs point of view, it also helped me understand the theories. I also like how the author includes not only US examples but also perspectives from Russia, China, etc. In fact, this was the most significant thing I picked up from this reading: The Internet seems like an open space, but there are actually invisible barriers between different sub-networks.  </p>

                <h3> 07. New Clues  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/internet-under-fire-gets-new-manifesto/">üîç</a></h3>
                <p>The internet is us; we form the Internet. On the other hand, Internet itself is neutral, it‚Äôs the people manipulating it with their good and/or bad intentions, that makes the internet have good or bad values. This article is discussing similar topics with the previous two articles, but it is interesting how this one is presented in a manifesto form, which I find more straightforward!</p>
